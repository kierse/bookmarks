Bookmark Synchronization
========================
- web service that can be run locally or under my pissiphany.com account
  - look at SOAP & SOAP::Lite, JSON, POX
- should be able to accept a full bookmark file or additions / changes to existing bookmarks
- support different bookmark files (work, personal, pr0n, etc).
- should be able to dynamically build a bookmark file based on bookmark files the user has requested, ie if user requests
  work and personal, it should be able to build a new bookmark file comprised of both sub bookmark files
- firefox plugin to use service.  Should use ajax gets/posts to administer bookmarks
- svn or database backend to "version" bookmark files
  - each bookmark can be 'tagged' one or more times
- should support both cgi and mod_perl

Functionality
=============
- each bookmark file should have a global counter, basically a version number.  The client would pass its counter value to
  the server and if they differ, the server should send back any changes.  Eventually this could be used to maintain a version
  history for all bookmark files.
