TODO
====
- look at using Fields method on Message object instead of passing fields has to Message constructor from
all child classes.
- fields method would have to maintain a hash identified by calling child class.
- every call to fields method would overwrite all previous data for calling class
- make sure logger and model are only being loaded once
- UNIVERSAL::require errors are not being properly thrown and caught
- update DBIx::Class error handling so that we don't get nested exceptions
  - change the anonymous sub that wraps the default DBIx::Class exception in Schema.pm
